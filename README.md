# Network-Analysis---Grain
This project's goal was to determine the least cost path from grain silos in the midwest to the port of New Orleans using roads, railroads, and rivers. The script iterates weekly, accounting for changing costs, and using counties with a FEMA disaster declaration (of chosen disasters) as barriers to the network.
